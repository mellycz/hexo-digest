Hyper saturated by media that promotes consumerism, individuals are incessantly distracted, tempted by advertisements, “news” and entertainment to no longer be concerned with how their beliefs and values measure up to any meaningful understanding of political ideology.

<!-- more -->

Deprived of a common political truth, the individual looks elsewhere for narratives to formulate a sense of identity. Advertisements are quick to fill the void. Advertisement campaigns exploit the individual for profit by selling goods not for their actual utilitarian value, but as a symbol of something more. This scenario is unfolding, particularly, in modern China.

Take the automobile manufacturer Jeep as an example. Jeep prides itself as producing vehicles that are well utilized as an off-road vehicle. The vehicle sells reasonably well in the US. In China however, Jeep sells more articles of clothing than it does vehicles. Gear is so popular that there are more than 1,500 licensed clothing outlets in the country, compared to only 160 auto dealers. How is Jeep able to reinvent itself as a clothing store? Through selling its image, the narrative that is created through media advertisements like those seen on Jeep’s website, Jeep is able to market any object that they can put their brand on.

When asked about the company in China, customer’s responses are telling: “A Jeep driver is one who doesn’t give up when faced with adversity,” says Ding Qi, a Shanghai businessman, who bought his wife a Jeep in 2014. Buying a Jeep is more than purchasing an automobile, it’s about buying a linguistic sign. In Qing’s case, a Jeep driver is someone who “doesn’t give up when faced with adversity.”

In China, owning a particular brand, like Harley Davidson for example, is reason to have a weekly social function. In one reported example, the individuals in a Harley Davidson club did not actually use the Harley motorcycles that they purchased. Instead, owners towed their Harleys to social functions and took pictures with other club members standing next to their similarly towed motorcycles.

The example is almost too perfect. Jeeps and Harleys are not being utilized for their designed purposes, but instead, are being utilized as something more: a sign function. Individuals are buying things they don’t use, and arguably do not need, because they are able to then share some limited form of commonality with others. 

This social exercise is important because it allows the individual to not only express their desired personality characteristics through purchasing things, but also create an opportunity to meet with others to reaffirm their shared choice of identity by gaining recognition. 

Yang Yang, 35, had this to say about Jeep, “I love the Jeep for its ruggedness. I remember one time we were going deep into the mountains in Anhui province and the villagers from surrounding villages came out to watch us. You don’t really feel it driving in the city, but when you get into the mountains or on a riverbed, you have this sense of superiority and joy”. Yang Yang loves the idea of the ruggedness of the Jeep, and the sense of superiority and joy that is gained from driving it in the mountains. For Yang Yang, the Jeep is much more than a vehicle, and was happy to buy it.

A perfect storm of obsessive consumerism is further enhanced by the individual's need to acquire recognition. By publically displaying purchased goods, individuals attempt to legitimize their identity by seeking recognition from others. Society becomes centred on this process of purchasing identity and seeking affirmation. Affirmation of chosen identity then becomes reasons to organize socially. Book clubs for particular books, sports bars for particular sports, clothes stores for a particular style, technology stores for a particular brand, the list cannot be exhausted.

The individual’s desire to find enduring satisfaction through this type of identity consumerism can only be realized through endless purchasing. If an object is no longer purchased because of a need, but instead a desire to associate with a certain symbol that represents an identity, the object isn’t serving a real purpose, rather it is serving a symbolic purpose. A symbol means nothing unless someone else agrees on its meaning. If an object loses popular agreement as to what it signifies, its value and utility becomes undesirable, sending the individual searching for the next socially accepted sign that fits in to the narrative of the preferred identity of the moment. 

The cycle of consumerism is kept alive by the impossibility for shared interpretation. A symbol's meaning is never wholly shared from one individual interpretation to another. It is both the tragedy and beauty of communication. The desire for individuals to find a place in some sense of a socially shared narrative pushes the mind to find acceptance and acknowledgement by others. Therefore, the individual becomes seduced into continuously attaining objects that are temporarily meaningful, without really achieving satisfaction. 

Consumption has reached a point where pleasure is no longer the only reason for beings to consume. Buying things has also become a way to acquire signs that identify each other’s ‘culture’ or ‘individuality.’  The Jeep store in the Beijing south railway station carries branded shirts, shoes, belts and backpacks, but not vehicles. The walls are covered with advertisements showing rugged looking men, or women hiking mountaintops. The store exemplifies the postmodern phenomenon. Jeep is selling a brand that represents a concept that people want to assimilate into their identity, without selling Jeeps.

In the postmodern age, apparently a good way to find others to socialize with, is to buy objects that can signify certain values or narratives and display them. If others recognize the sign and are attracted to connect with the individual than the object has helped reaffirm the individual’s confidence and sense of identity. Postmodernism is resulting in consumerism, or individuals buying objects out of insecurity. 

Corporations and governments support this excessive behaviour because of the symbiotic benefit of over-consumption and control that results. People work more than they have to, so that they can earn more capital to buy things they don’t need. The result is people are constantly working. When people are constantly working they are slaves. When people are slaves they are orderly. Governments enjoy this order because it means they can keep control. It's a powerful cycle, and it’s in Chinese cities the same as anywhere else.
